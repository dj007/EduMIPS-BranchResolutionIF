EduMIPS-BranchResolutionIF
==========================

We will also attempt to compare the performance if branches could be resolved during IF.  Methodology:  1. Change the EduMIPS64 architecture to accommodate for branching by incorporating flushing the pipeline. Perform tests of a standard MIPS program (eg. Gcc). Compare performance metrics (specifically total number of clock cycles), to default architecture (branch predict not-taken).  2. Change the EduMIPS64 architecture to predict-taken for branching. Similarly, we will perform tests of a standard MIPS program (eg. Gcc). Compare performance metrics (specifically total number of clock cycles), to default architecture (branch predict not-taken).  3. Change the EduMIPS64 architecture to resolve branches in the IF stage. This should remove the need for branch prediction. Similarly, we will perform tests of a standard MIPS program (eg. Gcc). Compare performance metrics (specifically total number of clock cycles), to default architecture (branch resolution in the EX stage).
